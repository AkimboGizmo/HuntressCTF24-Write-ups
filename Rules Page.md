Upon reading the rules of the Huntress CTF 2024 competition, I got to the "Flag Format" section. This section mention that a flag can be found on that very web page.

So I inspect the elements of the page to further investigate. I migrate to the body of the page coding and find the "Flag Format" section. Expanding the elements I find the flag hidden in the page.
